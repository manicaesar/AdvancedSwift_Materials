// For each exercise, you should provide solution in one line of code, without defining additional methods

// 1. Create an array of tuples where first element of tuple is the student name and second is his max remark:
// [(Samanta Malinowska, 4), (Brian Nowak, 5), ... ], etc. Order is NOT important.
// *) Instead of array of tuples, create dictionary where keys are student names and values are their max remarks.

// 2. Calculate sum of all remarks (expected result is 105)

// 3. Calculate mean of all remarks (expected result is 3.28125)

// 4. Return list - names of students that does not have any 1 with the exception for first remark. In other words, having 1 as a first remark is acceptable if the student does not have any more 1's.
// *) Sort the list by student's surnames. You can assume that every student name has form: "<firstName><space><surname>"
// Expected result: ["Jessica Kowalska", "Samanta Malinowska"]
